intro-body: The Cerulean network is not only designed with first-class support
  for Non Fungible Assets such as cute frog characters, but also is designed
  with energy efficiency in mind in order to be nicer to the environment. There
  are also plans in the works to enable burned funds to go to a pot for donation
  to various charities related to the environment, but this still needs more
  concept work done to figure out how feasible it is.
